Hi, I'm Jessie! (Pronouns: she/her; pronounced: Jeh-see Fin-uh-car-oh)

I am an incoming Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu), starting Sept 2024.
Currently, I am a [National Science Foundation Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2202898&HistoricalAwards=false) and [CRCS Fellow](https://crcs.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University, hosted by [Dr. Yiling Chen](https://yiling.seas.harvard.edu/). I also collaborate with [Teamcore](https://teamcore.seas.harvard.edu/), led by [Dr. Milind Tambe](https://teamcore.seas.harvard.edu/tambe).

I graduated from the [CS Theory](https://www.colorado.edu/cs-theory/) group at CU Boulder, working with [Dr. Rafael Frongillo](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~raf/).  In general, my research interests intersect Theoretical Machine Learning, Algorithmic Game Theory, and Computational Economics.  In particular, I am interested in understanding the design and impacts of objective function design in prediction and optimization tasks.  Previously, I was a 2019 [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.research.gov/grfp/AwardeeList.do?method=loadAwardeeList). 

I'm happy to chat about careers in research and my experience as a PhD student and postdoc. However, I sadly cannot meet with everyone who emails me; if we're not already acquainted, please add "Marshfield" to the subject line and please add a few words about why you're emailing me in particular.
