Hi, I'm Jessie! (Pronouns: she/her; pronounced: Jeh-see Fin-uh-car-oh)

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu).
Previously, I was a [National Science Foundation Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2202898&HistoricalAwards=false) and [CRCS Fellow](https://crcs.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University, hosted by [Dr. Yiling Chen](https://yiling.seas.harvard.edu/) and fellow of the Center for Research on Computation and Society ([CRCS](https://crcs.seas.harvard.edu)).
I graduated from the [CS Theory](https://www.colorado.edu/cs-theory/) group at CU Boulder, working with [Dr. Rafael Frongillo](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~raf/).  In general, my research interests intersect Theoretical Machine Learning, Algorithmic Game Theory, and Computational Economics.  In particular, I am interested in understanding the design and impacts of objective function design in prediction and optimization tasks.  Previously, I was a 2019 [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.research.gov/grfp/AwardeeList.do?method=loadAwardeeList). 

I'm happy to chat about careers in research and my experience as a PhD student and postdoc. Please feel free to send me an email with some details about why you're reaching out.
