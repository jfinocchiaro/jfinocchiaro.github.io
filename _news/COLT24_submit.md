[Rick](https://enriquenueve.github.io), [Dhamma](https://dkimpara.github.io), [Bo](www.bowaggoner.com), and I put our paper "Trading off Consistency and Dimensionality of Convex Surrogates for the Mode" on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10818). Special thanks to the students who led the way on this one.
