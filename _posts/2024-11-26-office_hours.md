## Every class has office hours... what are they?

Office hours are a time that professors and instructors set aside to meet with students. During my office hours, I am in the general area of my office (245 Beacon Room 528D) ready to chat if you want to drop by.

## What do I do if I want to chat but can't make office hours?

Most professors have office hours by appointment as well. For me personally, feel free to swing by and try and see if I'm around. If I am and free-ish, I'm usually happy to chat. If you want more predictability, feel free to schedule an appointment by link on Canvas.

## What's a good reason to come to office hours?

While the 'canonical' reason to come to office hours is with homework questions, office hours are a good place to come and discuss...
* your current class performance
* how to get involved in research (and learn what research is!)
* catching up from missed classes
* professional/internship advice
* clarify class expectations


## What are you doing if no one comes?

Personally, I try to schedule activities that I "don't mind getting interrupted" during my office hours. If you come to office hours, you're not interrupting much. Recently, my free-office-hour hobbies have included reading new papers and practicing LeetCode problems.
