      abstract={This paper aims to understand whether machine learning models should be trained using cost-sensitive surrogates or cost-agnostic ones (e.g., cross-entropy). Analyzing this question through the lens of H-calibration, we find that cost-sensitive surrogates can strictly outperform their cost-agnostic counterparts when learning small models under common distributional assumptions. Since these distributional assumptions are hard to verify in practice, we also show that cost-sensitive surrogates consistently outperform cost-agnostic surrogates on classification datasets from the UCI repository. Together, these make a strong case for using cost-sensitive surrogates in practice.},

  abstract={While some research fields have a long history of collaborating with domain experts outside academia, many quantitative researchers do not have natural avenues to meet experts in areas where the research is later deployed. We explain how conversations—interviews without a specific research objective—can bridge research and practice. Using collaborative autoethnography, we reflect on our experience of conducting conversations with practitioners from a range of different backgrounds, including refugee rights, conservation, addiction counseling, and municipal data science. Despite these varied backgrounds, common lessons emerged, including the importance of valuing the knowledge of experts, recognizing that academic research and practice have differing objectives and timelines, understanding the limits of quantification, and avoiding data extractivism. We consider the impact of these conversations on our work, the potential roles we can serve as researchers, and the challenges we anticipate as we move forward in these collaborations.},

  abstract={Decision-making systems increasingly orchestrate our world: how to intervene on the algorithmic components to build fair and equitable systems is therefore a question of utmost importance; one that is substantially complicated by the context-dependent nature of fairness and discrimination. Modern decision-making systems that involve allocating resources or information to people (e.g., school choice, advertising) incorporate machine-learned predictions in their pipelines, raising concerns about potential strategic behavior or constrained allocation, concerns usually tackled in the context of mechanism design. Although both machine learning and mechanism design have developed frameworks for addressing issues of fairness and equity, in some complex decision-making systems, neither framework is individually sufficient. In this paper, we develop the position that building fair decision-making systems requires overcoming these limitations which, we argue, are inherent to each field. Our ultimate objective is to build an encompassing framework that cohesively bridges the individual frameworks of mechanism design and machine learning. We begin to lay the ground work towards this goal by comparing the perspective each discipline takes on fair decision-making, teasing out the lessons each field has taught and can teach the other, and highlighting application domains that require a strong collaboration between these disciplines.},

In this work, we study the notion of the embedding dimension of a given discrete loss: the minimum dimension $d$ such that an embedding exists.

Recent work has been done on action and object recognition in egocentric videos, as well as work on biometric extraction from first-person videos. Height estimation can be a useful feature for both soft-biometrics and object tracking. Here, we propose a method of estimating the height of an egocentric camera without any calibration or reference points. We used both traditional computer vision approaches and deep learning in order to determine the visual cues that results in best height estimation. Here, we introduce a framework inspired by two stream networks comprising of two Convolutional Neural Networks, one based on spatial information, and one based on information given by optical flow in a frame. Given an egocentric video as an input to the framework, our model yields a height estimate as an output. We also incorporate late fusion to learn a combination of temporal and spatial cues. Comparing our model with other methods we used as baselines, we achieve height estimates for videos with a Mean Average Error of 14.04 cm over a range of 103 cm of data, and classification accuracy for relative height (tall, medium or short) up to 93.75% where chance level is 33%.}

Several hinge-like (piecewise-linear) surrogates have been proposed for the problem, yet all are either non-convex or inconsistent. For the proposed hinge-like surrogates that are convex (i.e., polyhedral), we apply the recent embedding framework of Finocchiaro et al. (2019; 2022) to determine the prediction problem for which the surrogate is consistent. These problems can all be interpreted as variants of top-k classification, which may be better aligned with some applications. We leverage this analysis to derive constraints on the conditional label distributions under which these proposed surrogates become consistent for top-k. It has been further suggested that every convex hinge-like surrogate must be inconsistent for top-k. Yet, we use the same embedding framework to give the first consistent polyhedral surrogate for this problem.}

These two scenarios typically involve different techniques for designing and analyzing surrogate losses. We unify these settings using tools from property elicitation, and give a general lower bound on prediction dimension. Our lower bound tightens existing results in the case of discrete predictions, showing that previous calibration-based bounds can largely be recovered via property elicitation. For continuous estimation, our lower bound resolves on open problem on estimating measures of risk and uncertainty.},

Recent work shows that continuous real-valued properties are elicitable if and only if they are identifiable, meaning the set of distributions with the same property value can be described by linear constraints. From a practical standpoint, one may ask for which such properties do there exist convex loss functions. In this paper, in a finite-outcome setting, we show that in fact essentially every elicitable real-valued property can be elicited by a convex loss function. Our proof is constructive, and leads to convex loss functions for new properties.},

  abstract={In the wake of increasing political extremism, online platforms have been criticized for contributing to polarization. One line of criticism has focused on echo chambers and the recommended content served to users by these platforms. In this work, we introduce the fair exposure problem: given limited intervention power of the platform, the goal is to enforce balance in the spread of content (e.g., news articles) among two groups of users through constraints similar to those imposed by the Fairness Doctrine in the United States in the past. Groups are characterized by different affiliations (e.g., political views) and have different preferences for content. We develop a stylized framework that models intra- and intergroup content propagation under homophily, and we formulate the platform's decision as an optimization problem that aims at maximizing user engagement, potentially under fairness constraints. Our main notion of fairness requires that each group see a mixture of their preferred and non-preferred content, encouraging information diversity. Promoting such information diversity is often viewed as desirable and a potential means for breaking out of harmful echo chambers. We study the solutions to both the fairness-agnostic and fairness-aware problems. We prove that a fairness-agnostic approach inevitably leads to group-homogeneous targeting by the platform. This is only partially mitigated by imposing fairness constraints: we show that there exist optimal fairness-aware solutions which target one group with different types of content and the other group with only one type that is not necessarily the group's most preferred. Finally, using simulations with real-world data, we study the system dynamics and quantify the price of fairness.},

Leveraging a recent embedding framework, we instead derive the target loss for which the Lovász hinge is consistent. This target, which we call the structured abstain problem, allows one to abstain on any subset of the k predictions.

Little is known, however, about the performance of traditional PTO and decision-focused learning when exposed to adversarial label drift. We provide modifications of traditional PTO and decision-focused learning that attempt to improve robustness by anticipating label drift. When the predictive model is perfectly expressive, we cast these learning problems as Stackelberg games. With these games, we provide a necessary condition for when anticipating label drift can improve the performance of a PTO algorithm: if performance can be improved, then the downstream optimization objective must be asymmetric. We then bound the loss of decision quality in the presence of adversarial label drift to show there may exist a strict gap between the performance of the two algorithms. We verify our theoretical findings empirically in two asymmetric and two symmetric settings. These experimental results demonstrate that robustified decision-focused learning is generally more robust to adversarial label drift than both robust and traditional PTO.}

A complete graph with a hole, Kd +v, consists of a complete graph on d vertices, Kd , and a set of independent vertices of size v, V, where each vertex in V is adjacent to each vertex in Kd . When d is even, we give two constructions for the decomposition of a complete graph with a hole into copies of K4 − e : the Alpha-Delta Construction, and the Alpha- Beta-Delta Construction. By restricting d and v so that v = 2(d 1−) 5−a , we are able to resolve both of these cases for a subset of Kd + v using difference methods and 1-factors.}

We use property elicitation to take first steps towards understanding the joint relationship between the loss and regularization functions and the optimal decision for a given problem instance. In particular, we give a necessary and sufficient condition on loss and regularizer pairs for when a property changes with the addition of the regularizer, and examine some regularizers satisfying this condition standard in the fair machine learning literature.

In some work, minimizing the opponent’s score is an additional objective. Here, we explore the role of explicitly optimizing for mutual cooperation in IPD player performance. We implement a genetic algorithm in which each member of the population evolves using one of four multi-objective fitness functions: selfish, communal, cooperative, and selfless, the last three of which use a cooperative metric as an objective. As a control, we also consider two single- objective fitness functions. We explore the role of representation in evolving cooperation by implementing four representations for evolving players. Finally, we evaluate the effect of noise on the evolution of cooperative behaviors. Testing our evolved players in tournaments in which a player’s own score is the sole metic, we find that players evolved with mutual cooperation as an objective are very competitive. Thus, learning to play nicely with others is a successful strategy for maximizing personal reward.}

  abstract={Supervised machine learning algorithms are often predicated on the minimization of loss functions which measure error of a given prediction against a ground truth label. The choice of loss function to minimize corresponds to a summary statistic of the underlying data distribution that is learned in this process. Historically, loss function design has often been ad-hoc, and often results in losses that are not actually statistically consistent with respect to the target prediction task. This work focuses on the design of losses that are simultaneously convex, consistent with respect to a target prediction task, and efficient in the dimension of the prediction space. We provide frameworks to construct such losses in both discrete prediction and continuous estimation settings, as well as tools to lower bound the prediction dimension for certain classes of consistent convex losses. We apply our results throughout to understand prediction tasks such as high-confidence classification, top-k prediction, variance estimation, conditional value at risk, and ratios of expectations.}

  abstract={In multiclass classification over n outcomes, the outcomes must be embedded into the reals with dimension at least n−1 in order to design a consistent surrogate loss that leads to the "correct" classification, regardless of the data distribution. For large n, such as in information retrieval and structured prediction tasks, optimizing a surrogate in n−1 dimensions is often intractable. We investigate ways to trade off surrogate loss dimension, the number of problem instances, and restricting the region of consistency in the simplex for multiclass classification. Following past work, we examine an intuitive embedding procedure that maps outcomes into the vertices of convex polytopes in a low-dimensional surrogate space. We show that full-dimensional subsets of the simplex exist around each point mass distribution for which consistency holds, but also, with less than n−1 dimensions, there exist distributions for which a phenomenon called hallucination occurs, which is when the optimal report under the surrogate loss is an outcome with zero probability. Looking towards application, we derive a result to check if consistency holds under a given polytope embedding and low-noise assumption, providing insight into when to use a particular embedding. We provide examples of embedding n=2d outcomes into the d-dimensional unit cube and n=d! outcomes into the d-dimensional permutahedron under low-noise assumptions. Finally, we demonstrate that with multiple problem instances, we can learn the mode with n2 dimensions over the whole simplex.}

  abstract={In standard resource allocation problems, the designer sets the objective---such as utilitarian social welfare---that captures a societal goal and solves for the optimal allocation subject to fairness and item availability constraints. The participants, on the other hand, specify their preferences for the items being allocated, e.g., through stating how they rank the items or expressing their cardinal utility for each item. The objective function, which guides the overall allocation, is therefore determined by the designer in a top-down manner, whereas participants can only express their preferences for the items. This standard preference elicitation stage limits participants' ability to express preferences for the overall allocation, such as the level of inequality, and influence the overall objective function.

In this work, we examine whether it is possible to use this bottom-up preference elicitation stage to enable participants to express not only their preferences for individual items but also their preferences for the overall allocation, thereby indirectly influencing the objective function. We examine this question using a well-studied resource allocation problem where m divisible items must be allocated to 
n agents, who express their cardinal utilities over the items. The designer aims to optimize for the sum of the agents' utilities for the items they receive. In particular, this utilitarian objective is agnostic to the overall inequality level. We consider a setting where the agents' true utility is a function not only of their preferences for the items, but also the overall level of inequality. We model this using a popular social preference model from behavioral economics by Fehr and Schmidt, where agents can express levels of inequality aversion.

We conduct a theoretical examination of this problem and show that there can be large gains in social welfare if the designer uses this richer inequality-aware preference model, instead of the standard inequality-agnostic preference model. Further, if we take the standard inequality-agnostic welfare as the benchmark, we show that the relative loss of welfare can be tightly bounded--shown to be independent of the number of agents and linear in the level of inequality aversion. With further assumptions on the preferences, we provide strictly tighter, distribution-free, and parametric bounds on the loss of welfare. We also discuss the worst-case drop in inequality-agnostic utility an agent might incur as a consequence of a designer allocating items using the inequality-averse preferences. We conclude with a discussion on possible designs to elicit the preferences of strategic agents over the goods and fairness. Taken together, our results argue for potentially large gains that can be obtained from using the richer social preference model and demonstrate the relatively minor losses from using the standard model, highlighting a promising avenue for using preference elicitation to empower participants to influence the overall objective function.}

  abstract={Analyses of voting algorithms often overlook informational externalities shaping individual votes. For example, pre-polling information often skews voters towards candidates who may not be their top choice, but who they believe would be a worthwhile recipient of their vote. In this work, we aim to understand the role of external information in voting outcomes. We study this by analyzing (1) the probability that voting outcomes align with external information, and (2) the effect of external information on the total utility across voters, or social welfare. In practice, voting mechanisms elicit coarse information about voter utilities, such as ordinal preferences, which initially prevents us from directly analyzing the effect of informational externalities with standard voting mechanisms. To overcome this, we present an intermediary mechanism for learning how preferences change with external information which does not require eliciting full cardinal preferences. With this tool in hand, we find that voting mechanisms are generally more likely to select the alternative most favored by the external information, and when external information reflects the population's true preferences, social welfare increases in expectation.}
